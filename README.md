## Description

The Didactic Equilibrium Evaluation Node is an Arduino-based project designed for educational purposes to evaluate balance and motion. It incorporates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor for motion sensing and utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless data transmission.

## Features

- **Real-time Motion Sensing:** Utilizes an IMU sensor to capture motion data in real-time.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Connectivity:** Enables wireless data transmission to external devices.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple and straightforward setup process for quick deployment.
- **Educational Use:** Ideal for educational settings, practical demonstrations, and learning about motion sensing technologies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/didactic-equilibrium-evaluation-node.git
   ```

2. **Setup Arduino Environment:**
   - Install the necessary Arduino IDE and libraries.
   - Connect the Arduino board to your computer.

3. **Upload Code:**
   - Open the Arduino sketch (`.ino`) file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to your Arduino board.

4. **Connect IMU Sensor:**
   - Connect the IMU sensor to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board.

5. **Start Data Transmission:**
   - Follow the documentation to connect to the BLE device and begin receiving motion data.
